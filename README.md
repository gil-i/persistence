# Persistence

The aim of this repository is to implement some of the basic known algorithms for calculating the persintent homology of a filtration. 
These algorithms are based on Dey's book https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/tamaldey/book/CTDAbook/CTDAbook.pdf

This repo uses simplex tree  implementation from:
    Boissonnat, Jean-Daniel, and Cl√©ment Maria. "The simplex tree: An efficient data structure for general simplicial complexes." Algorithmica 70.3 (2014): 406-427.
